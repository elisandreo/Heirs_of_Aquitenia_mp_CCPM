accepting_flemish_people_desc;The Flemish of the late Duchy of Brabant are very similar to our own people linguistically and culturally. Really, we are the same people separated for too long by political borders. Let us rectify this by embracing the Flemish as our brothers!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

union_brabant_desc;The Duchy of Brabant has been absorbed into our lands, now we shall mend the cultural rift created between our people due to artificial political borders.

aid_BYZ_ALB_desc;The Empire is facing a difficult time right now, and we have managed to secure autonomy. If we play our cards right, we can attain independence!

annexation_of_saxony_title;The Annexation of Saxony;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
annexation_of_saxony_desc;Saxony failed to take part in the Brunswick Congress, but they must not be allowed to remain outside the German question. They will join us peacefully, as much for their protection against our neighbors as for the protection of all Germans. If they do not, war is no doubt near for them.;x,,,,,,,,,,
approach_aqt_title;Approach Aquitania;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
approach_aqt_desc;Both Naples and the Padan Union have expressed a territorial interest in our islands. As they know we would refuse to join them, this interest is expressed as a military threat to our sovereignty. Aquit�nia is a new-born republic like our own. We should build our relations with them, in order to secure our republic.;;;;;;;;;x ,,,,,,,,,,,
barbarian_islands_title;Settle the Barbarian Islands;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
barbarian_islands_desc;For generations, we have exercised limited control over Hokkaido, to our north, and had even less contact with the savage natives of Takasago Koku, to our south. We should extend the beneficence of civilization to their misty shores.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

Calling for all Greeks to rise up and defend the country from the incoming Roman reprisal, he laid the groundwork of Greek liberal nationalism with his 40-minute speech.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
bohemian_zadar_title;The Zadar Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bohemian_zadar_desc;Bohemia is one of the most powerful and industrialised countries in the world, yet we are landlocked and dependent on our neighbours to conduct international trade. We should change this. Having a warm relationship as we do, perhaps we could propose that Croatia lease us that port in Zadar, and we will, in return, fund railroads which both we and they can use, as well as giving them a sum of money. Our ministers expect that approximately 25,000 will be sufficient to sway them.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
boukoleon_restoration_title;Restore the Boukoleon Palace;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
boukoleon_restoration_desc;The Boukoleon Palace was the residence of the Emperors of the Roman Empire from the 11th century until the 16th century, when it was damaged by Armenian occupations during the many wars when the Empire was on its back foot at the height of Muslim power. Since then, it has stood in ruins, as the Emperors have had other concerns. Restore and rebuild the palace to beautify and glorify our city!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
BRB_sell_new_brabant_islands_title;Sell the New Brabant Islands;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRB_sell_new_brabant_islands_desc;Since the loss of Zeeland, we no longer have the means to maintain our far-flung colonies of New Brabant in the west Pacific. As long as we're abandoning them, we should try to make some profit off of them. Let's look for someone to buy them.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
BRT_is_France_title;Brittany is part of France!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BRT_is_France_desc;Brittany was a part of France not much more than a century ago. They have enjoyed their independence for long enough. Having shown them our might when we reclaimed our colony, they can't possibly refuse to rejoin us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,

buy_dutch_natal_title;Buy Dutch Natal;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
buy_dutch_natal_desc;After the conclusion of the Emden Accords, the cession of Oostkaap to $COUNTRY$ isolated the former territory of the Steenkooler republic of Natal. The Dutch had difficulty administering this territory as resident Zulus began to make trouble. By offering to buy the land and incorporate it into our colonies in South Africa, we can take this problem off of their hands.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
call_brunswick_congress_title;Call the Brunswick Congress of Germans;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
call_brunswick_congress_desc;Given the recent Bavarian violation of Mainzer sovereignty, it is clear that the king in M�nich does not intend to abide by the terms of the Peace of Augsburg. Therefore, it is time to summon the old allies to a congress to propose a more permanent response to the Bavarian threat - to join forces under one banner and one ruler for the good of all!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
call_brunswick_congress2_title;Call the Brunswick Congress of Germans;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
call_brunswick_congress2_desc;Agitation among the inhabitants of the various states of the old Holy Roman Empire has been increasing recently. Calls for German unification and a rising sense of kinship that transcends political borders has caused some unrest among the people because of the rivalries of the princes. We should call delegates from around the north to discuss the situation. External threats are another concern that will weigh heavily on delegates' minds and we will likely see many states banding together politically.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cancel_zadar_lease_title;Cancel the Zadar Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cancel_zadar_lease_desc;With the fall from grace of Bohemia, they are no longer able to make use of their port. Indeed, they don't even have the means to access it at the time. Let us unilaterally end the lease and retake Zadar.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
cancel_zadar_lease_HUN_title;Cancel the Zadar Lease;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cancel_zadar_lease_HUN_desc;Our relations with Hungary have soured in recent years, and they have acted increasingly insulting towards us despite our generosity in leasing them Zadar. Let us punish their foolishness by canceling their lease unilaterally and retaking Zadar for ourselves, no matter the consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
cede_emden_title;Cede Emden;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cede_emden_desc;With the failure of the diplomatic option in the proposed Emden Accords with our German neighbour, we are faced with a difficult decision. Tensions over the city will only continue to mount, and we must ask ourselves if we want to risk war to hold such a small region. If we cede the city to German and relinquish our claims, a costly war could be avoided.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
cisalpines_are_italian_title;The Padanians are Italian!;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cisalpines_are_italian_desc;The Cisalpine people of Padania speak a language quite similar to ours, and have long shared in the cultural and economic life of the Italian peninsula. Given our power, especially compared to theirs, surely none will dare oppose us for claiming what is rightfully ours. Gloria per la patria!;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
claim_aegean_title;Claim the Aegean Islands;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_aegean_desc;The Empire is in no position to maintain control over these islands, which have much more in common with our ideas of trade and prosperity than the dusty old notions of empire and blind loyalty to the royalty in Constantinople. We will lay claim to these islands and take them for ourselves, for the good of their inhabitants and ours;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_balearics_title;Claim the Balearic Islands;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_balearics_desc;The Balearic Islands of Mallorca and Menorca have long held an important position in the trading of the western end of the Mediterranean, and acquiring them would bolster our reputation and ability to control and conduct trade in that region. By claiming the islands, we risk war with some powerful neighbours, but it must be done for the good of all citizens of the Republic!;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
claim_bar_lorraine_title;Claim Bar and Lorraine;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_bar_lorraine_desc;The French crown's ownership of Bar and Lorraine can be traced back to the time of Charlemagne. The two duchies were part of the Holy Roman Empire, but, being on its periphery, never were an integral part, and remained neutral in the Imperial War. They are populated by French-speaking peoples, and our spies tell us there is some support for joining us. Other countries may laugh at our claim, but we will take Bar and Lorraine for ourselves! Fortitudo per unitatem!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
claim_brittany_title;Claim Breizh;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_brittany_desc;We have long been sundered from our brothers on the European continent, proud descendants of the last holdouts from the Romans, and last holdouts of our once-numerous and great people on the continent. Now that we have reclaimed power in the north, let us extend our protection to our Breizhoneg brothers in Brittany and ensure that they will never have to face the world alone!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
claim_carapara_title;Claim the Carapara Islands;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

claim_corsar_desc;Corsica and Sardinia have long held an important position near the rich cities of Aquit�nia, Provence, and the north of the Italian Peninsula.

By claiming the islands, we risk war with some powerful neighbours, but it must be done for the good of all citizens of the Republic!;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
claim_elsass_lothringen_title;Claim Elsass;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_elsass_lothringen_desc;There are Germans to be found in territory nominally controlled by the French. We should remedy this situation and annex this region as a buffer zone between the revanchist French and our industrial heartland.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

claim_empire_BAV_desc;Our ascendant position among our German brethren and the increasing consolidation of our kingdom means we have the means, the will, and the right to finally prove to the world that we are the rightful rulers of Germany.

claim_galicia_title;Claim Galicia;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_galicia_desc;With our newfound power, we have the credibility and the strength to bring our northern cousins under our benevolent rule. Maybe we'll have to fight Hispania for them, but it'll be worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_heptanesa_title;Claim Heptanese Islands;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_heptanesa_desc;The Heptanese islands of Zakynthus and Kerkyra have long held an important position at the mouth of the Adriatic.

claim_malta_title;Claim Malta;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

claim_roman_throne_title;Claim the Roman Throne;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_roman_throne_desc;Evangelos Melisurgos, uncle to 15-year old Georgius, the current Autokrator of the Roman Empire through his father, Ioannes, feels that he is better suited to lead the Roman Empire in this time of rebellions and crises. By enacting this decision, you will preempt the game event which will fire approximately 9 months after Anatole has a military score of 10. You have until then to prepare for war to take the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
claim_rose_title;Claim Ros�;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_rose_desc;Daufinat has chosen to join the Padan Union, but this is primarily because of the Cisalpine inhabitants of the Piemont. The inhabitants of the Ros� River valley and regions nearby - even in the Alps - are much closer to ours in terms of culture and language, and it would be better if they were united with their kin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_sicily_title;Claim Sicily;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_sicily_desc;Sicily has long held an important position separating the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean, and has changed hands many times throughout the centuries. Acquiring this populous island would bolster our reputation and ability to control and conduct trade in the central Mediterranean. By claiming Sicily, we risk war with some powerful neighbours, but it must be done for the good of all citizens of the Republic!;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
claim_suazi_title;Claim the Lands of the Suazi;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

claim_venice_PDN_title;Assert Our Claim to Venice;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_venice_PDN_desc;A foreign conqueror stole Venice from the Cisalpine people while our federation was taking its first breaths, a time when we were unable to contest the conqueror.

claim_wales_cornwall_title;Claim Cymru and Kerno;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_wales_cornwall_desc;As we grow in strength, we may challenge Aengland for control over our Celtic brothers in Cymru and Kerno. We will, of course, have to fight a long and hard war if we want to actually hold these territories, but we can face that when the time comes.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
claim_zeeland_title;Claim Zeeland;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
claim_zeeland_desc;Being a great and powerful nation, others will surely not deny that we are the rightful owners of Zeeland. Indeed, some of the towns and cities of the region expressed interest in joining our kingdom when we united in 1814. However, they already belonged to the Duchy of Brabant, and the Duke there was not friendly to the cause we represented. Now, however, we can take Zeeland by force, if we must.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
colonise_drytsiben_title;Colonise Drytsiben;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colonise_drytsiben_desc;We should expand out to the edge of our claims on the plains so that no one else can take them from us. These lands may be fertile farmlands, or perhaps some useful resources might be found in them. Besides, more land for our growing population is always good.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
colonise_jukuna_title;Colonise Jukuna;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colonise_jukuna_desc;The lands that the natives call Jukuna are, quite frankly, inhospitable. But with the gold and other riches we found in Iggatlan, there may be more further north! Besides, some opportunistic states, like Dabimon or Hispania, may in time try to lay claim to the north, and thus try to envelop us in some way. Let us instead settle some key outposts and ensure that these lands are made ours!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
colonise_necen_title;Colonise Necen;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

colonise_newea_title;Colonise Newea;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colonise_newea_desc;The vast plains of the center of Ameriga stretch far north, and the region we have come to call Newea is the northern limit of good farmlands. If we take it, we can secure our frontier and acquire fertile land for the good of $COUNTRY$.;x,,,,,,,,,,,
colonise_oai_title;Colonise Oailand;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colonise_oai_desc;There yet remain unclaimed areas of the inner plains of Ameriga, inhabited by a few savages clinging to their ways.

Let us claim the territory for our own, before someone else takes it!;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
colonise_rouge_ues_title;Colonise Rouge-Ues;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colonise_rouge_ues_desc;It is time to expand into the interior of the northern plains. These are vast, treeless expanses, but explorers have long claimed that they would be fertile farmland and grazeland. It will cost some money to fund settlements in key locations to establish our claims, but rest assured, it'll be worth it.;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
colonise_ters_dauror_title;Colonise the Interior of the Ters d'Auror;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
colonise_ters_dauror_desc;These lands in the far north of the continent are not good for much, being filled with stunted forests and permafrost, but if we don't claim them, someone else might, like Skamisc or another greedy country. Who knows, maybe one day some use may come of these lands.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

declaration_of_mantua_ai_desc;In 1849, the Council of the Union, at the behest of its constituent rulers and in light of the growing strength and cohesion of the Union's armed forces, made a joint proclamation to the world. Considered to be the seeds of a national identity, the Declaration decreed that all states which the Neapolitan kingdom had absorbed must be released by Neapolitan King Giuseppe I Salenino. It further stated the ambition of the Padan Union to annex the Romagna region into its territory, given its proximity to the namesake Po River. By issuing this declaration, war between Naples and the Union was a foregone conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

declare_romanian_unity_desc;With the instability and troubles in the Empire, the growing nationalist unrest in the Volasean provinces could finally be funelled into a successful movement.

embrace_romansh_title;Protect Romansh People;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
embrace_romansh_desc;The Romansh people are a small minority we inherited after annexing Helvetia. Too few to have their own country, members of local Romansh communities have petitioned our government for official protection, as was the case under the Helvetian government. They cite their strong ethnic and cultural ties to Germany - despite their strange language -, as well as their past services to Helvetia, which they would gladly pass to us as their new rulers should we allow them the same rights as proper Germans. Offering protection to such a petty minority might demean a country as great as ours, but would be looked up favorably in the eyes of foreign moralists, as well as helping to restore a sense of normalcy to the former Helvetian cantons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

enlist_tatars_desc;The more populous crown of Smolensk, which falsely claims to be heir to Russia, has many more soldiers than do we. There is, however, opportunity. The Tatars, the once-feared horselords of the steppe, are divided subjects of both countries. If we curry favour with them, we may be able to destabilize Smolensk, allowing us to defeat them. By accepting the Kazani Tatars as equals, we may gain an important advantage with all of the inhabitants of the steppe. However, stories of their cruelty remain and the other peoples of our empire may not be so happy.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

expand_halesca_title;Expand Halesca;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expand_halesca_desc;Given Skamisc and other countries' ambitions in North Ameriga, it seems prudent to claim the land all the way to the Skamisc border at the 141st parallel. That way, none can try to sneak around us, and we can exploit the resources to be found in our rich, if far-flung, colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

expand_to_kilikia_desc;With the war over and peace restored, we can once again look outward. The Muslims in Armenia are weak and hold territory that was once Roman. Let us reclaim it and cut them off from the Mediterranean, thus weakening them further.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,

expedition_to_okhotsk_desc;In 1845, Count Bogdan Svetayev was commissioned by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to explore and lay claim to lands at the western coast of Asia beyond the recently conquered lands of the Yakuts.

form_zachadia_desc;Some philologists have confirmed what we have already long known: that the Poles, Czechs, Silesians, Slovaks, and Sorbs all speak closely related languages. These languages they have come to call the Western Slavic family. Given our cultural, linguistic, and geographical proximity, we could unite our peoples into a truly great nation.'\n\n\ $Y NB: Western Slavs must control Silesian and Polish cores (Slovakia can be owned by them, or Hungary can be puppeted), and Prague/Bohemia must be sphered and puppeted with +100 relations.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

further_the_revolution_in_DAU_desc;The monarchists of our cousins in Daufinat are facing serious opposition from their own liberal people, who seek to set up a democracy similar to the one we have been so successful in establishing.

greek_macedonia_arbenon_desc;Now that we have proven our strength to the failing Empire and to the world, it is time to expand our democracy to the north, to the ancient Greek lands before the Empire established its rule over us all those long centuries ago.

helvetian_patrimony_desc;The Germans of the South are united under one flag. Almost united. The cantons of Helvetia, long isolated by choice from Germany proper, must be brought into the fold.

hispania_by_sword_title;Begin the Reconquista;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hispania_by_sword_desc;Hispania was always one of the dominant powers in western Europe, but in 1829, the League of the Ten Monarchs violently and unjustly stripped away many of our core lands to limit our power even as they restored us to our rightful place on the throne. By declaring a Reconquista of all Iberia, we will announce our objective to take back what was once ours. Hispania will rise again, and may the consequences damn whoever stands in our way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,

HtA_POL_setup_title;Poland Setup;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
HtA_POL_setup_desc;Poland is ruled not only by the king, but also by the Sejm - a legislative chamber composed of nobles of the realm who vote by majority rule. This body has met semi-annually for six weeks since time immemorial. A democratic body, it stands in stark opposition to the more absolutist methods of rule Poland's neighbours employ. The involvement of nobility tends to guarantee their investment in the well-being of the state, and this has effects beyond the legislation the body produces: each member ensures that the land he owns is as prosperous as can be.;x,,,,,,,,,,

incite_byelorussians_desc;If we are to continue to weaken our rival in Smolensk, then it will not be on the field of battle, but in the hearts and minds of the downtrodden minorities of their empire. We will stir up local grievances in order to sow chaos in their country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
incite_ukrainians_title;Incite Ukrainians;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
incite_ukrainians_desc;The Ukrainians have long had a separate identity from the Great Russians, even those of Smolensk. Their culture and language are similar, but their history of fraternization with the Cossacks has institutionalized distrust against them by the ruling elites of the country. We can inflame old tensions to strengthen the Ukrainians and to cause further headaches for Smolensk.;x,,,,,,,,,,,
incorporate_brabant_title;Incorporate Brabant into the Netherlands;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
incorporate_brabant_desc;Now that we've claimed Zeeland, why not just get the rest of the Duchy of Brabant, too?

Incorporating the Flemish of Brabant is a natural step in continuing to ensure our greatness.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
info_RUS_title;HtA Russia Info;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
info_RUS_desc;War with Smolensk will come later, it's designed that you can't fabricate on them right away. Focus on building up your military and getting through the decision chains to sow discontent in their territory and get allies. Go as far east as possible with colonization. Only after you've taken the decision to incite Ukrainians will the CB become available for both countries (or if it's after 1850).;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
info_SML_title;HtA Smolensk Info;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
info_SML_desc;You start in a very strong position to overwhelm Russia (indeed, it should be easy!), but you'll have to be patient. You'll be able to fabricate the special casus belli later after certain conditions are met - namely the Russians have to have taken a decision to incite your Ukrainian POPs (or if it's after 1850). The reason for not being able attack right away is that the populace of Smolensk, being highly faithful, would never (initially) support a war against Russia. To be honest, I don't expect a lot of people to play Smolensk because it's likely to be a boring first two or three decades.;x,,,,,,,,
inland_claims_title;Our Inland Claims;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
inland_claims_desc;Uilscyr has been making plans to go up and claim the far reaches of the tributaries of the Jordrac River. This would bring them uncomfortably close to our territory.

integrate_cymru_desc;It was only in 1829 that the Duke of Cymru, Owain of Aberdaugleddau, made his realm subservient to ours, in a moment of diplomatic clarity. However, recent events between our two countries and a changing diplomatic situation abroad necessitate that we establish direct control over the Cymraeg lands. Perhaps the Duke can be made to see reason, but if not, then use of force must be considered.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

norwegian_caribbean_title;Issue the Declaration of Kajahikos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
norwegian_caribbean_desc;For a great many years the king in Anslo had been forced to accept the sovereignty of various elected legislative bodies due to the strictures of the Constitution of 1822, which was ultimately accepted by the royal family under duress. However, the alignment of many of those legislative bodies with the destabilizing forces of Albesanism and the subsequent royal coup, which saw members of the royal family and the solidly absolutist army and navy dissolve the liberal constitution, have rendered the king a free hand in Norway. With support for the royals and Nordic nationalism both at an all-time high, and the Norwegian Navy quite large and abundantly capable of projecting force in the region, Olav Erling, the Duke of Faroe, has traveled to the Norwegian-held island of Kajahikos and, acting on orders from his elder brother King H�kon IV, proclaimed the intent of the Norwegian Crown to annex the islands of Firgene, Heymak, Curasu, and Welighefen by right of conquest.
